I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I work as a research assistant in the CharmML Lab under the guidance of Dr. Srijan Das. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, robot learning, and multimodal AI.

I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from MNIT Jaipur. My passion for research was ignited during my master’s program, where I actively contributed to several conferences.
