I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte under the guidance of [Dr. Srijan Das](https://srijandas07.github.io/) and co- advised by [Dr. Pu Wang](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/pwang13/index.html). Prior to this, I received a master’s degree in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from MNIT Jaipur. My research focuses on computer vision, robot learning, and multimodal AI, with a particular interest in developing generalist and foundational models for real-world robots.

<!-- My passion for research was ignited during my master’s program, where I actively contributed to several conferences.  My research aims to bridge the gap between perception and action in robotics, enabling robots to seamlessly interact with dynamic, real-world environments. I am passionate about designing generalist and foundational models that empower robots to learn, adapt, and perform diverse tasks with minimal supervision. -->
