I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I am advised by [Dr. Srijan Das](https://srijandas07.github.io/). I am part of the CharmML Lab, working as a research assistant, with a focus on computer vision, robot learning, and multimodal AI. I hold a master's degree from UNC Charlotte and a bachelor's degree in computer science from MNIT Jaipur. My passion for research was sparked during my master's program, where I actively contributed to multiple conferences.
